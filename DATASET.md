# CSIRO Pasture Biomass Prediction - Dataset Description

## Description

Farmers often walk into a paddock and ask one question: "Is there enough grass here for the herd?" It sounds simple, but the answer is anything but. Pasture biomass - the amount of feed available - shapes when animals can graze, when fields need a break, and how to keep pastures productive season after season.

Estimate incorrectly, and the land suffers; feed goes to waste, and animals struggle. Get it right and everyone wins: better animal welfare, more consistent production, and healthier soils.

Current methods make this assessment more challenging than it could be. The old-school "clip and weigh" method is accurate but slow and impossible at scale. Plate meters and capacitance meters can provide quicker readings, but are unreliable in variable conditions. Remote sensing enables broad-scale monitoring, but it still requires manual validation and can't separate biomass by species.

This competition challenges you to bring greener solutions to the field: build a model that predicts pasture biomass from images, ground-truth measures, and publicly available datasets. You'll work with a professionally annotated dataset covering Australian pastures across different seasons, regions, and species mixes, along with NDVI values to enhance your models.

If you succeed, you won't just improve estimation methods. You'll help farmers make smarter grazing choices, enable researchers to track pasture health more accurately, and drive the agriculture industry toward more sustainable and productive systems.

## Evaluation

### Scoring

The model performance is evaluated using a **globally weighted coefficient of determination (R²)** computed over all (image, target) pairs together.

Each row is weighted according to its target type using the following weights:

- **Dry_Green_g**: 0.1
- **Dry_Dead_g**: 0.1
- **Dry_Clover_g**: 0.1
- **GDM_g**: 0.2
- **Dry_Total_g**: 0.5

This means that instead of calculating R² separately for each target and then averaging, a single weighted R² is computed using all rows combined, with the above per-row weights applied.

### R² Calculation

The weighted coefficient of determination $R²_w$ is calculated as:

$$
R²_w = 1 - \frac{\sum_j w_j(y_j - \hat{y}_j)^2}{\sum_j w_j(y_j - \bar{y}_w)^2}
$$

where $\bar{y}_w = \frac{\sum_j w_j y_j}{\sum_j w_j}$

#### Residual Sum of Squares $SS_{res}$

Measures the total error of the model's predictions:

$$
SS_{res} = \sum_j w_j(y_j - \hat{y}_j)^2
$$

#### Total Sum of Squares $SS_{tot}$

Measures the total weighted variance in the data:

$$
SS_{tot} = \sum_j w_j(y_j - \bar{y}_w)^2
$$

#### Terms

- $y_j$: ground-truth value for data point $j$
- $\hat{y}_j$: model prediction for data point $j$
- $w_j$: per-row weight based on target type
- $\bar{y}_w$: global weighted mean of all ground-truth values

## Competition Overview

The competition requires predicting the following 5 biomass components:

* Dry green vegetation (excluding clover)
* Dry dead material
* Dry clover biomass
* Green dry matter (GDM)
* Total dry biomass

Accurately predicting these quantities will help farmers and researchers monitor pasture growth, optimize feed availability, and improve the sustainability of livestock systems.

## File

**test.csv**

* `sample_id` — Unique identifier for each prediction row (one row per image–target pair).
* `image_path` — Relative path to the image (e.g., `test/ID1001187975.jpg`).
* `target_name` — Name of the biomass component to predict for this row. One of: **`Dry_Green_g`,** **`Dry_Dead_g`,** **`Dry_Clover_g`,** **`GDM_g`,** `Dry_Total_g`.

The test set contains over 800 images.

**train/**

* Directory containing training images (JPEG), referenced by `image_path`.

**test/**

* Directory reserved for test images (hidden at scoring time); paths in `test.csv` point here.

**train.csv**

* `sample_id` — Unique identifier for each training *sample* (image).
* `image_path` — Relative path to the training image (e.g.,`images/ID1098771283.jpg`).
* `Sampling_Date` — Date of sample collection.
* `State` — Australian state where sample was collected.
* `Species` — Pasture species present, ordered by biomass (underscore-separated).
* `Pre_GSHH_NDVI` — Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GreenSeeker) reading.
* `Height_Ave_cm` — Average pasture height measured by falling plate (cm).
* `target_name` — Biomass component name for this row (`Dry_Green_g`, **`Dry_Dead_g`,** **`Dry_Clover_g`,** **`GDM_g`, or** `Dry_Total_g`).
* `target` — Ground-truth biomass value (grams) corresponding to `target_name` for this image.

**sample_submission.csv**

* `sample_id` — Copy from **`test.csv`; one row per requested (image,** `target_name`) pair.
* `target` — Your predicted biomass value (grams) for that `sample_id`.

### What you must predict

For each **`sample_id` in** ***`test.csv`** , output a single numeric* ****`target`** value in** ***`sample_submission.csv`** . Each row corresponds to one* `(image_path, target_name)` pair; you must provide the predicted biomass (grams) for that component. The actual test images are made available to your notebook at scoring time.
